Run - Import project into Eclipse using > General > Projects from Folder or Archive.  Then run as Spring Boot App.

Browse - Using postman browse to http://localhost:8080/graphql and then use the GraphQL option in the body. Ensure POST is selected as request method.


Step 1: When submitting query below, the first time it should return a vehicle stating, no such vehicle exists in the vehicle details (not pretty but just proving a point here).

Step 2: Submit mutation below to add vehicle to data source, currently a H2 in memory database (The DB resets and clears down everytime the spring boot app is re-started).

Step 3: Submit the query again, and now you should see the data you submitted in step 2.

NB.  This code just proves the point that data can come from a data source, and can be altered before being sent on from the API to the client by the code.

Step 4: Now run through steps 1 - 3 in debug mode to see what is happening, put a break point in VehicleQuery.java line 33.


Query (use this):

query {
    
        vehicle(id: 1)
        {
           id
           type
           modelCode
           brandName
           launchDate
           
        }
    
    
}

Mutation (use this):

mutation {
    
        createVehicle(type:"Xi", modelCode:"Fiesta", brandName:"Ford", launchDate:"2013-01-11")
        {
           id
        }   
    
}
